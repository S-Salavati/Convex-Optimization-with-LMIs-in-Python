# Convex-Optimization-with-LMIs-in-Python-and-MATLAB
Solving Semidefinite Programming (SDP) and Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) with CVXPY and YALMIP 
This code intends to compute the optimal numerical solution to convex constraints in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)
for mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) regulation in clinical resuscitation for critical hypotensive patients.

The details of linear parameter-varying (LPV) of dynamic MAP response to vasoactive drug injection with the parameter estimation
scheme methodology can be found in the following papers. Square-root cubature Kalman filter is utilized for parameter estimation 
and has its own details and complexity which will not be discussed in these files. In this work, I have added injection 
magnitude constraints, known as input saturation, to the original problem. Simulations are conducted via MATLAB Simulink where
the files are subject to copyright and not provided.

In these codes, I have computed the matrix variable parameters for the output feedback control of automated drug infusion. The
controller is designed to satisfy the LMI constraints of the induced L_2-norm characterization of the closed-loop system, AKA
H_\infty control in linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. The MATLAB and Python codes are computing the same variables. MATLAB is
equipped with YALMIP and MOSEK solver, and CVXPY is equipped with MOSEK and SCS solvers. However, YALMIP may seem better and
more versatile in terms of performance and computational time, specifically for handling complicated LMIsand constraints as in
my problem.
